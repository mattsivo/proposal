Short answers for the below questions suffice. If you want to alter your plan for your project (and obtain approval for the same), be sure to email your section leader directly!

#### What have you done for your project so far?

We created code that made a color scale that will determine the strength of password. For example, red is bad, yellow is okay, green is good. We also worked on password requirements in the form of if/elif statements. For example, the password must be a certain length and have certain charcaters. 

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

We need to connect the color scale to our if/elif statements. Right now, they are separet codes. 

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

No problems currently
